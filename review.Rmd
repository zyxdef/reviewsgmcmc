# Introduction

As required by the editorial board of this Journal of Statistical Software, I proceeded to reviewing the submission identified above in three fronts: 

- one *article* review on the file `sgmcmc.pdf`; and 
- two *package* reviews on the contents of the file `sgmcmc_0.2.0.tar.gz`, taking into account the contents of the auxiliary file `reproduction_material.tar.gz`.

All three files above were analysed as provided by the editorial board.

As a disclaimer, I neither assessed the performance of the package nor conducted benchmarking tests with existing alternatives to stochastic gradient MCMC.

The result of the three independent reviews will be presented in what follows.

# Package Reviews

## Methodological Review

This review intends to assess whether or not the package succeeded implementing the SGMCMC samplers as proposed in the article.

### Sampler `sgld` -- Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics

### Sampler `sghmc` -- Stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

### Sampler `sgnht` -- Stochastic gradient Nosé-Hoover thermostat

### Sampler `sgldcv` -- Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics with control variates

### Sampler `sghmccv` -- Stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with control variates

### Sampler `sgnhtcv` -- Stochastic gradient Nosé-Hoover thermostat with control variates

## Package Mechanics Review

### Introduction

This review intends to assess whether or not the package organization is free of flaws, as well as whether or not the package attained a seamless integration with the external software *TensorFlow*.

At the moment I started this review, the *sgmcmc* package was already available online at [CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sgmcmc/index.html) in its version 0.2.0 (the same I received from JSS editors) and its source was accessible in the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/STOR-i/sgmcmc).

I conducted this review with the following conditions:

- Hardware setting: 
    - Dell Inspiron 7520 laptop
    - Intel Core i7 processor with 8 cores
    - 8 Gb RAM
- Software setting:
    - Lubuntu version 17.10 with kernel version 4.13.0  [**???**]
    - Python version 3.6.3 [**???**]
    - TensorFlow version 1.4.0 [**???**]
- R setting:
    - R version 3.4.2 [@RLang]
    - package *tensorflow* version 1.4.1 [**???**]
    - RStudio IDE version 1.1.391  [**???**]

As a disclaimer, I did not test *sgmcmc* package with in the following particular conditions:

- in Windows or OSX operating systems;
- with Python 2; and
- with TensorFlow GPU capabilities.

As an online reference for this review, I considered the [*Review guide for analysis best practice*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYcWJUk-MiM2C1TIHB1Rn6rXoF5fHwRX-7_C12Blx8g) from the [*rOpenSci Analysis Best Practice Guidelines*](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/checkers), developed at [*rOpenSci “Unconference” 2017*](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/).

### Organizational Aspects of the Package

#### Instalation

For starters, I tried to install **sgmcmc** directly from CRAN:

```{r check.install, width=60}
install.packages(
  "sgmcmc", 
  repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org",
  destdir = "install", 
  dependencies = T, 
  verbose = T
)
```

As it can be seen, I was able to install **sgmcmc** version 0.2.0 (the same version sent to me by the editors) directly from CRAN in Linux, so the package was able to build successfully.

Also, the file downloaded from CRAN and the file received from the editor are the same, as it should be expected and as it can be seen:

```{r diff, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, error=TRUE}
system2(
  "bash", 
  " -c 'LC_ALL=c diff -s originals/sgmcmc_0.2.0.tar.gz install/sgmcmc_0.2.0.tar.gz'", 
  stdout = T
)
```

##### Reference Manual

##### Helpfiles

#### Vignettes, Datasets and Examples

##### Vignette `sgmcmc` -- Getting Started

This vignette introduces the basics of utilization of the *sgmcmc* package.  Accordingly, it points the reader to articles that are referrences for each one of the three methods implemented (SGLD, SGHMC, and SGNHT), but, unfortunately, the link to the SGLD article was broken and the browser returned a `404 - Not Found` error, as it can be seen in [this figure](#deadlink).  In the same paragraph, there is also a reference to some "recent publication" that links to the [GitHub page of the *sgmcmc* project](https://github.com/jbaker92/stochasticGradientMCMC) instead of an actual publication.

The orientations about how to specify dataset, parameters, log likelihood, and log prior are are clear and precise, albeit that the user must know how to handle TensorFlow library references, as it can be seen in the log likelihood and log prior presented as examples, which make reference to functions from TensorFlow library (*viz.*, `tf$contrib$distributions$MultivariateNormalDiag()`, `tf$contrib$distributions$StudentT()`, and `tf$reduce_sum()` in this vignette), and the paragraph that makes reference to possible quirks that the user may experience when dealing with the integration between R and TensorFlow.

In this sense, the utilization of TensorFlow is not made transparent by the *sgmcmc* package, but, since this desirable feature was never proposed by the package authors, it is not a problem.

##### Function `getDataset()` and Datasets `covertype` and `mnist`

##### Vignette `gaussMixture` -- Gaussian Mixture

##### Vignette `logisticRegression` -- Logistic Regression

##### Vignette `mvGauss` -- Multivariate Gaussian

##### Vignette `nn` -- Bayesian Neural Network


### Integration with the library *TensorFlow*

As I previouly installed the package *tensorflow* and ran `tensorflow::install_tensorflow()`,
